# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project course. In this project,
I will build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few
recipes. The website doesn't have to look pretty.

In this project, I will demonstrate my HTML skills, as well as my terminal
workflow and using basic Git and GitHub functionalities.
